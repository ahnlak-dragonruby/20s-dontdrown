Don't Drown
===========

Good life advice, and a game written for the [20 Second Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/20-second-game-jam)
as well. This marks my return to DragonRuby for ... umm, well, longer than I
care to add up so it will be rough around the edges, sorry.

As always, the source for the game is licensed under the MIT License (see LICENSE)
but as I'm using some features of the Pro edition of DragonRuby you will need
that to be able to build.

The Game
--------

Make your way out of a maze of tunnels, bridges and ledges as the water level rises.
Move fast enough and you'll escape. Don't, and you'll drown.

The Assets
----------

Having no real artistic talent, I've used some of [V3x3d](https://v3x3d.itch.io/block-land)'s
awesome work for the graphics. It is, as ever, beautiful and also CC0 - see the
license details in `dontdrown/sprites/`

Fonts are from Google Fonts, under OFL - again, see the license details in `dontdrown/fonts/`.
